"""Run NCBI routines to identify contaminant and vectior contigs.

The contaminants are presumably sequences that were not screened out
in the filter step.

This uses NCBI fcs tool for screening which relies on a singularity
engine installed

The default libraries for screening are located in resources.py
and include common Euk, Prok, and MITO contaminants.
