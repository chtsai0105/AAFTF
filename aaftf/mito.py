    """Assemble a mitochondrial genome from paired reads with NOVOPlasty.

    Two sequences steer the run:

    * the **seed** is where NOVOPlasty starts assembling; it extends the seed with matching
      reads until the genome is complete (bundled default: an *A. nidulans* cob fragment,
      ``aaftf/data/mito-seed.fasta``);
    * the **start gene** only matters afterwards: a circular assembly is rotated to begin at the
      cob gene, found by aligning a bundled consensus of fungal cob genes
      (``aaftf/data/mito-start-cob.fasta``).

    Mitochondrial reads are usually at far higher coverage than nuclear ones, so by default the
    input is capped at ``subsample`` randomly chosen read pairs (the same pairs on every run) to
    save time and memory. NOVOPlasty may also subsample on its own to stay within ``memory``.

    A circularized assembly is written as a single rotated ``mt`` record; otherwise the contigs
    are written as ``contig_N``.

        left: Forward reads FASTQ.
        right: Reverse reads FASTQ.
        out: Output FASTA path.

        minlen: Minimum expected genome size (NOVOPlasty genome range).
        maxlen: Maximum expected genome size (NOVOPlasty genome range).
        seed: FASTA of the NOVOPlasty seed; None uses the bundled *A. nidulans* cob fragment.
        subsample: Keep only this many randomly chosen read pairs (BBTools ``reformat.sh``);
            0 uses all reads.
        memory: Max memory in GB for NOVOPlasty (and ``reformat.sh``).
        debug: Keep the work directory.
        pipe: Unused; accepted for pipeline consistency.
        **kwargs: Other parsed CLI attributes (``command``, ``func``, ``quiet``, ...); ignored.
