"""Support pipelining of AAFTF to simplify all-in-one runs.

Three pipelines, one per kind of sequencing data:

* ``pipeline_short`` (Illumina): trim → filter → assemble → vecscreen → sourpurge → rmdup → sort → assess.
* ``pipeline_long`` (ONT/PacBio): assemble (Flye) → polish (Racon) → vecscreen → rmdup → sort → assess.
* ``pipeline_hybrid`` (Illumina + long reads): trim → filter → assemble (Flye on the long reads) →
  polish (Racon, then Polypolish or pypolca with the Illumina reads) → vecscreen → sourpurge → rmdup
  → sort → assess. With ``--method unicycler`` both read types go to Unicycler, which polishes its own
  assembly, so the polish steps are skipped.

Every step runs with its own ``AAFTF <step>`` defaults; only the options given to the pipeline (and
the file names that chain the steps together) override them.
