``AAFTF -h`` lists the subcommands in three groups: *Setup* (``dependency``, ``database``),
*Assembly pipeline* (``trim`` through ``pipeline``, in the order above; steps marked "(Optional)"
are not run by ``pipeline``) and *Annotation* (``fix_tbl``).

Common options and exit codes
=============================

Every subcommand accepts ``-v/--verbose`` (verbose logging; also usually retains temp working
directories) and ``-q/--quiet`` (only warnings and errors, which also hides the "your next
command might be" hint printed at the end of a step).

Each step with a working directory also writes its log to ``<workdir>/<subcommand>.log`` (everything
at INFO and above, even with ``-q``, plus full tracebacks on errors). The log is kept whenever the
working directory is: when you pass your own ``-w/--workdir``, with ``-v``, or when the step fails;
an auto-created working directory and its log are removed after a successful run. Subcommands
without a working directory (e.g. ``trim``, ``sort``, ``assess``) write ``./<subcommand>.log`` only
with ``-v``.

``AAFTF`` exits with status 0 on success, 1 on an error, 2 when a required input file, database or
tool is missing, and 130 when interrupted with Ctrl-C.
