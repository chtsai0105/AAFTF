# Changelog

## 0.7.0 (Development)

Changes since `v0.7.0-beta.4`. This is a large refactor: many command-line options changed, so
check the **Breaking changes** before updating scripts.

### Breaking changes

 - **Package renamed** from `AAFTF` to `aaftf` for imports (`import aaftf`, `from aaftf.utility import ...`).
   The PyPI distribution and the `AAFTF` command keep their names.
 - **Read options renamed**: `-l/--left` and `-r/--right` are now `-1/--read1` and `-2/--read2` in
   `trim`, `mito`, `filter`, `assemble`, `sourpurge`, `polish`, `depth` and `pipeline`
   (`-r` remains `--report` in `assess` and `fix_tbl`).
 - **Subcommands renamed**: `check_dependencies` → `dependency`, `download` → `database`. Subcommand
   aliases (e.g. `asm`, `stats`, `purge`, `gx`) were removed; each subcommand has one name.
 - **Common flags**: the version flag is now `-V/--version`; `-v` is now `-v/--verbose` (was
   `-v/--debug`). The `--pipe` option was removed from every subcommand: "next command" hints are
   shown unless `-q/--quiet` is given.
 - **Removed options**: `assemble --method dipspades` and `--haplocontigs` (dipSPAdes is no longer
   packaged by SPAdes); `mito --reference` and `mito --starting` (circular mitochondrial genomes are
   always rotated to start at the cob gene); `fix_tbl` no longer reads stdin / writes stdout via `-`.
 - **`pipeline` no longer runs `polish` or `mito`**: it runs trim → filter → assemble → vecscreen →
   sourpurge → rmdup → sort → assess, and each step now uses its own command-line defaults
   (e.g. `assemble` with `--isolate`, `polish` default `polypolish`) unless a pipeline option overrides
   them. `pipeline -m/--memory` is now passed to every step that has `-m` (was 75% of RAM).
 - **Databases are downloaded only by `AAFTF database`**: `filter`, `vecscreen`, `sourpurge` and
   `fcs_screen` read them from the database folder and stop with the `AAFTF database ...` command to
   run when one is missing (`filter -a/-u` still download what they are given). `$AAFTF_DB` may list
   several folders separated by `:`, and defaults to `~/.cache/aaftf`.
 - **Exit codes**: errors now exit with 1, a missing input file, tool or database with 2, and Ctrl-C
   with 130 (the traceback is shown with `-v`).
 - **Changed defaults / behaviour**:
   - `assess` default telomere monomer is now `TAAC{3,5}`.
   - `mito` subsamples to 1,500,000 read pairs by default (`--subsample 0` uses all reads).
   - `-m/--memory` is an integer number of GB everywhere (`assemble` used a string).
   - `vecscreen` writes its outputs next to `-o/--outfile` (was always the current directory).
   - `assess` reports BASES MASKED / PERCENT MASKED only when the assembly is soft-masked.
   - `fcs_gx_purge` drops only contigs FCS-GX marks EXCLUDE (TRIM/FIX/REVIEW rows are warned about
     and kept; previously every reported contig was dropped).

### Added

 - **`dependency`** (was `check_dependencies`): checks the tools and Python packages in two groups —
   what the default pipeline needs (an error if missing) and what only optional steps or non-default
   options use — printed in a fixed order with each tool's location or where a missing one is used;
   `-q` prints only the status. Suggests rebuilding bowtie2 for AVX2 when the conda build is installed.
 - **`database`** (was `download`): lists every reference database with its size, users and storage
   folder, split into databases the default pipeline needs and optional ones; downloads them by short
   name, file name, `required`, `optional` or `all`; `--force` re-downloads.
 - **`mito --subsample PAIRS`** (default 1,500,000; BBTools `reformat.sh`, fixed seed), and a
   "next command" hint that suggests `filter -s <mito.fasta>` to screen mitochondrial reads out.
 - **Per-step log files**: steps with a working directory write `<workdir>/<step>.log` (INFO and above
   even with `-q`, full tracebacks on errors), kept whenever the working directory is kept (own `-w`,
   `-v`, or a failed run); steps without one write `./<step>.log` with `-v`.
 - `-c/--cpus` and `-m/--memory` are lowered to what the machine/job can provide, with a warning.
 - Grouped `AAFTF -h` (Setup / Assembly pipeline / Annotation) with optional steps marked "(Optional)".
 - `depth`: quantized coverage plots (heatmap and barplot, paginated by contig length), `--min_contig_len`,
   `--no-plot`, `--plot-format`; errors on samtools merge/index/flagstat failures.
 - pixi environments `default` (default pipeline), `complete` (every optional tool) and `dev` (tests
   and lint), mirrored by `environment.yml` and `environment.dev.yml`; an `install-bowtie2` task that
   rebuilds bowtie2 with AVX2 support.
 - Documentation site (`docs/`, Read the Docs) with a page for every subcommand, including `dependency`.
 - GitHub Actions CI (`ci.yml`): pre-commit lint, unit tests on Python 3.10–3.14, integration tests in
   the locked pixi environment, and a strict Sphinx docs build.
 - conda package recipe (`ci/recipe/recipe.yaml`, rattler-build) and a publishing workflow.

### Changed

 - `polish` is optional and recommended only with long reads; `rmdup`'s next-command hint now suggests `sort`.
 - `fix_tbl` rewritten: features are clipped at trimmed contig ends and marked partial (`<`/`>`),
   features inside trimmed regions or on excluded contigs are dropped, minus-strand features and
   multi-interval features are handled, and the output is written via a temporary file so a failed
   run never leaves a truncated table.
 - `sourpurge`: the classification status must be exactly `found`; `--just-show-taxonomy` saves the
   classification CSV and cleans up its working directory.
 - `rmdup` reads the assembly once and matches contig IDs exactly.
 - `-h` output unified across subcommands: consistent help text and metavars (`FASTQ`, `FASTA`, `DIR`,
   `INT`, `GB`, `BP`, `PCT`, `PREFIX`) and a consistent option order (inputs, outputs, working
   directory, options, CPUs, memory, `-q`/`-v`, then tool-specific options).
 - Aligner → sorted BAM steps pipe straight into `samtools sort --write-index` (samtools >=1.13; no
   intermediate SAM files).
 - Bundled data (NOVOPlasty seed, config template, cob start sequence) is read with `importlib.resources`.
 - Containers build the pixi `complete` environment and report the correct version (`AAFTF_VERSION`
   build argument, converted to PEP 440).
 - Release workflow understands prerelease tags (e.g. `v0.7.0-beta.4` + `prerelease` → `v0.7.0-beta.5`);
   PyPI builds use the full git history so the published version matches the tag.

### Fixed

 - `assemble --method megahit` passed `-m` to MEGAHIT as bytes (32 GB became 32 bytes); it is now
   converted from GB. An existing MEGAHIT output folder is refused instead of failing inside MEGAHIT.
 - `assemble`: SPAdes restart passed `--restart-from last` as one argument; Unicycler dropped the paired
   reads when `--merged` was given; a missing assembly output now fails the step.
 - `trim`: the Trimmomatic adaptor search ignored `<prefix>/share/trimmomatic`, and the found adaptor
   file was never passed to Trimmomatic; missing reads or adaptors now raise errors.
 - `filter`: an unknown `--aligner` silently produced no output; the single-end hint suggested an
   `assemble` command that would not parse.
 - `fcs_screen` failed when FCS-adaptor had already created its output folder; FCS failures are reported.
 - `fcs_gx_purge` ignored `run_gx.py` failures.
 - `mito` picked NOVOPlasty's output by directory order (a circular assembly could be missed); a run
   with no assembly now fails.
 - `sourpurge` crashed when no N50 contig had coverage data (the filter is now skipped with a warning).
 - `assess` crashed on missing or empty input and never closed its report file.
 - `depth`: `-1` and `--longread_preset` were listed as required in `-h`; samtools failures were ignored.
 - `vecscreen` left input files open.
 - Trim/filter work around a BBDuk PairStreamer bug in paired mode; `pipeline` type mismatches that
   crashed `sourpurge` and `polish` were fixed.

### Removed

 - `assemble --method dipspades` and `--haplocontigs`; `mito --reference` and `--starting`; the `--pipe`
   option; subcommand aliases; the old `check_dependencies` / `download` names.
 - Unused utility functions and duplicated helpers across modules (consolidated in `aaftf/utility.py`).
 - Obsolete shell-script "tests", BUSCO/AUGUSTUS benchmark files and cluster-only test data from `tests/`.
 - Unused packages from the environments and conda recipe (pilon, masurca, diamond, flye, fastqc,
   hifiasm, kraken2, gfatools, taxonkit).

### Known issues

 - `sourpurge --sourdb_type gtdb` / `gtdbrep`: the GTDB databases are downloaded as sourmash `.dna.zip`
   collections but `sourmash lca classify` needs LCA databases, so these options likely fail (the
   default `gbk` database works). See `TODO.md`.

### Internal

 - Every `run()` takes its command-line option names as keyword arguments; all argparse menus live in
   `aaftf/_menu.py`; subcommands raise exceptions instead of calling `sys.exit`; logging uses the
   `logging` module.
 - Google-style docstrings and type hints throughout; mypy-clean; PEP 8 names; ruff targets Python 3.10.
 - Test suite rewritten and extended (about 700 tests, 96% line coverage), with tests isolated in
   temporary directories.

## 0.6.1 (unreleased notes, superseded by 0.7.0)

### Tests

 - **New pytest test suite** (`tests/`): 144 unit tests, all passing.
   Requires `pip install pytest pytest-cov biopython`.  Run with `python -m pytest tests/`.
   - `tests/conftest.py` — shared fixtures (FASTA/FASTQ files, mosdepth summary data, argparse Namespaces)
   - `tests/test_utility.py` — pure-Python functions in `utility.py`: `myround`, `calcN50`, `RevComp`, `softwrap`, `checkfile`, `line_count`, `countfasta`, `fastastats`, `countfastq`, `which`, `SafeRemove`
   - `tests/test_assess.py` — `assess.py`: `revcomp`, `findTelomere` (fwd/rev/T2T/none), `genome_asm_stats` (GC%, N50, L50, telomere counts, gz input, file output), `run()`
   - `tests/test_sort.py` — `sort.run()`: descending-length order, header renaming, minlen filtering, sequence content preservation
   - `tests/test_fix_tbl.py` — `fix_tbl.py`: `parse_tbl` (blanks, comments, partial coords), `parse_adjustments` (left/right trim, multi-range), `fix_tbl` (trim_left shifts, trim_right clamps, pass-through)
   - `tests/test_depth.py` — `depth.py` pure functions: `count_fastq_reads`, `parse_mosdepth_summary`, `_coverage_breadth_from_dist`, outlier threshold arithmetic
   - `tests/test_cli.py` — CLI framework: `ALIAS_MAP` completeness, argparse defaults/required-args for `depth`/`assess`/`sort`, `--help` exits, alias routing
   - pytest configuration added to `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.pytest.ini_options]`); dev dependencies in `[project.optional-dependencies]`

### Added

 - **New `depth` subtool** (`AAFTF/depth.py`): calculates read depth of coverage for a genome assembly.
   Maps Illumina paired-end reads (via `minimap2 -ax sr` or `bwa mem`) and/or long reads (via `minimap2 -ax map-ont/map-pb/map-hifi`) to the assembly using a pipe chain (mapper stdout → `samtools sort`; no intermediate SAM files written to disk), then runs `mosdepth` to compute per-contig depth statistics.
   When both read types are provided their BAMs are merged before mosdepth.
   Writes `coverage_stats.txt` (configurable via `-o`) with three sections:
   1. Read input summary — per-file read counts and `samtools flagstat` alignment rates per read type
   2. Whole-assembly coverage — two mean depth estimates: mosdepth global (length-weighted) and per-contig arithmetic mean; plus % bases covered ≥1x
   3. Per-contig depth table sorted descending — two outlier tiers: `** OUTLIER` (mean > assembly mean + 3×SD, likely contaminant/organelle) and `ELEVATED` (2–3 SD above mean, worth inspecting)
   CLI: `AAFTF depth -i genome.sorted.fasta [-l fwd.fq] [-r rev.fq] [-lr longreads.fq] [-c cpus] [-o report]`
   Aliases: `coverage`, `cov`
   Required external tools: `minimap2` and/or `bwa`, `samtools`, `mosdepth`

### Fixed

 - **CLI alias routing**: Added `ALIAS_MAP` to `run_subtool()` in `AAFTF_main.py` so all argparse aliases (`asm`, `stats`, `dedup`, `pilon`, `polca`, `fix`, `purge`, `gx`, `trim_reads`, `read_trim`, `filter_reads`, `read_filter`, `vectorscreen`, `vector_blast`, `ncbi_fcs`, `ncbi_fcs-screen`, `ncbi_fcs-gx`, `ncbi_fcs_gx`, `mito_asm`, `mitochondria`) correctly dispatch to their canonical submodule instead of falling through to print-help-and-exit.
 - **`pipeline.py` assess step**: Fixed `AttributeError` — `assess_args` Namespace now includes `telomere_monomer` and `telomere_n_repeat` attributes required by `assess.run()`.
 - **`pipeline.py` assemble step**: Removed stale `asm_args.spades_tmpdir = None` assignment (wrong attribute name; `tmpdir` is already correctly populated via `assembleOpts`).
 - **Missing parser flags**: Added `-v/--debug` to `parser_assess`, `parser_sort`, and `parser_mito`; added `--pipe` to `parser_assess` and `parser_sort`; added `-v` shorthand to `parser_rmdup`'s `--debug` flag for consistency across all subcommands.
 - fcs_gx seemed like it was writing reports in the input fasta folder not the targeted output folder, should be fixed

### Enhanced

 - **Version reporting now includes git checkout hash**: Enhanced version system to include short git commit hash (7 characters) for development installations. Version format examples:
   - Clean working tree: `0.6.0-alpha1-7-g261967e+261967e`
   - Dirty working tree: `0.6.0-alpha1-7-g261967e.dirty+261967e`
   - Tagged release: `0.6.0+261967e`
 - Version information is automatically detected from git repository for `pip install -e .` installations
 - Maintains backward compatibility with packaged installations and PEP 440 compliance
 - Improved development traceability and debugging support
